                        <h3>Understanding how the web works</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>In order to create efficient websites, you must understand the underlying processes of the web.</li>
                                <li>These include: hosting, serving and rendering</li>
                                <li>Internet != (not equal to) the web</li>
                                <li>The web is interactions between clients and servers</li>
                                <li>Servers deliver the content while clients request and show the content</li>
                                <li>Lots web servers to handle the different types of data and services</li>
                            </ul>
                        <hr>

                        <h3>Working with clients and servers</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Whenever you visit a website, either through clicking or typing, a request to show the content of that particular website is made.</li>
                                <li>URL - Uniform resource locator</li>
                                <li>DNS - Domain Name Server</li>
                                <li>Request (URL)  made to DNS which then is turned into an IP address</li>
                                <li>HTML text is rendered first, followed by CSS/images, and then Javascript </li>
                                <li>Static sites just require the content that is requested.</li>
                                <li>Dynamic sites must be processed by a web app before it can rendered.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <hr>

                        <h3>The DNS and why it matters</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>A website is assigned a unique IP address</li>
                                <li>Helps identify its location</li>
                                <li>IP addresses are cumbersome to work with, for humans at least. </li>
                                <li>To make it easier, websites are given a unique domain name that is connected to it’s IP.</li>
                                <li>Domain name sent to a name server → server finds address → server returns the IP address → IP address helps find the website you wanted</li>
                                <li>DNS system is a database thats distributed across the world.</li>
                                <li>First DNS database that is contacted is the ISP default DNS. </li>
                                <li>If not found in the default, then it is checked through the root name server</li>
                                <li>DNS caching helps speed up the process.</li>
                                <li>If DNS is not handled correctly, then no one will be able to acces your website.</li>
                                <li>DNS servers refresh their cache every 24 hours. </li>
                            </ul>
                        <hr>

                        <h3>Internet Protocols</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>HTTP - Hypertext transfer protocol</li>
                                <li>Standard for transferring resources</li>
                                <li>Browser clients and web server are both HTTP(S) based</li>
                                <li>Other common web protocols are: FTP (File transfer Protocol), SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), and RTP (Real Time Transport Protocol)</li>
                                <li>HTTP is a one way stateless protocol.</li>
                                <li>FTP differs from HTTP because FTP connects to a file server to help download or upload files. HTTP has trouble transmitting or receiving large files.</li>
                                <li>SMTP is used to send emails while POP (Post Office Protocol) is used for receiving.</li>
                                <li>RTP is for delivering audio and video.</li>
                                <li>For HTTP, once a request is made and received, it is forgotten by both parties.</li>
                                <li>Storing data must be done through another way. </li>
                                <li>Cookies are small text files that the website writes on the client machine.</li>
                                <li>HTTPS is HTTP with a security layer on top. </li>
                            </ul>
                        <hr>

                        <h3>Anatomy of a URL</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Web link example: http://www.lynda.com</li>
                                <li>Http: This is the protocol. Tells the browser to use HTTP for the protocol</li>
                                <li>Middle part is the link (www.lynda.com)</li>
                                <li>Also known as resource name. </li> 
                                <li>‘Www’ is the subdomain, while ‘lynda’ is the domain name</li>
                                <li>Domain name is what the browser uses to check with the DNS to see if it exists.</li>
                                <li>‘Com’ is the top level domain.</li>
                                <li>Subdomain is a mostly a thing of the past. Often times it isn’t required anymore</li>
                                <li>Many different subdomains, not just www. Server admin can create subdomains whenever they want</li>
                                <li>A url also specifies the path on the server and port</li>
                                <li>Most servers default to port :80</li>
                                <li>If needed to include them, just append them after the top level domain with a colon in between</li>
                                <li>Can also pass in parameters to the server using the url</li>
                                <li>Parameters are called name-value pairs.</li>
                                <li>Url parameters are often passed in by form submittals or user clicking on specific areas due to the complexity of them.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <hr>

                        <h3>How Browsers Work</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Browsers use the HTTP to communicate with web servers and request content</li>
                                <li>Whenever a link is clicked, the browser sends a request for a document</li>
                                <li>One the browser receives the requested content, it then renders it.</li>
                                <li>Additional content is then rendered if the browser supports the file types ( either by default or through extensions)</li>
                                <li>Client side scripting is then executed when it gets triggered</li>
                                <li>Browser UI - contains visuals such as address bars and interface components</li>
                                <li>Rendering engine parses HTML/CSS and controls the rendering process</li>
                                <li>Built in networking components that are used to communicate with common internet protocols</li>
                                <li>Cookies are often used as the data storage component</li>
                                <li>Javascript interpreter executes JS code</li>
                                <li>Five most common rendering engines: Trident, Gecko, Presto, WebKit and Blink.</li>
                                <li>Blink is based on WebKit but being developed by Google</li>
                                <li>Web designers should test pages in multiple versions of the same browser. This is because older browser versions use older rendering engine versions.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <hr>

                        <h3>Web Standards and the W3C</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Back in the day, web browsers built and used proprietary features.</li> 
                                <li>This caused headaches and issues since web designers had to make their pages compatible with each browser.</li>
                                <li>Web Standards Project created in 1998</li>
                                <li>Supported the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)</li>
                                <li>Issued recommendations that everyone should follow</li>
                                <li>Beneficial to learn web standards and stay up to date with them, since it’ll give you a better guarantee that your websites will be consistent across browsers.</li>
                                <li>Best to take into account the web standards when designed, modifying as needed per browser.</li>
                                <li>The W3C website lists the specifications for languages.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <hr>

                        <h3>Web Server Basics</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Web server is just a computer with specific software and hardware.</li>
                                <li>All web servers have a IP address. The websites the servers host are all registered through a DNS.</li>
                                <li>Virtual hosting allows a webserver to serve more than just one website.</li>
                                <li>Shared hosting environment - website is hosted on a web server that hosts other websites as well.</li>
                                <li>Dedicated hosting - Your website has it’s own server</li>
                                <li>Websites are stored as a series of files and folders. The HTTP retrieves these files/folders upon request</li>
                                <li>Dynamic websites must first process data from database and run any server side scripts.</li>
                                <li>Web Stack - Stack of software that all works together to serve and process web pages.</li>
                                <li>Not all servers use the same stack.</li>
                                <li>Common web stack includes: OS, web server, database server, and programming language</li>
                                <li>LAMP stack - Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl</li>
                                <li>Most commonly used web stack, due to each part of the stack is open-source</li>
                                <li>WAMP stack - Windows, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl</li>
                                <li>Make sure that your choice of hosting service has a compatible web stack for your scripting and database needs.</li>
                            </ul>

                                <li>A lot more development is being done within the browser compared to the past</li>
                                <li>New and powerful Javascript libraries have allowed tasks to be done in-browser instead of on a remote server.</li>
