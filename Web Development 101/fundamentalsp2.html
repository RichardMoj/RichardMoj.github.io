                        <h3>Common Image Types</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Four most commonly used image formats: JPG, GIF, PNG, SVG</li>
                                <li>Need to find a balance between file sizes and quality of images</li>
                                <li>Higher quality images take more bandwidth and vice-versa</li>
                                <li>Bandwidth serious concern as we have low bandwidth connections but high-resolution displays (Phones/tablets)</li>
                                <li>Browser must support image format to be able to display it. Most do since they have come standards.</li>
                                <li>JPEG - Joint Photographic Experts Group</li>
                                <li>Supports millions of colors - making it ideal for photos with lots of colors</li>
                                <li>However, they are compressed with lossy compression which makes their image quality go down.</li>
                                <li>Compressed each time they are saved.</li>
                                <li>GIF - Graphics Interchange Format</li>
                                <li>Support limited animation. 8-bit which means only 256 colors</li>
                                <li>PNG - Portable Network Graphics</li>
                                <li>Lossless and supports millions of colors</li>
                                <li>High file sizes</li>
                                <li>SVG - Scalable Vector Graphic Files</li>
                                <li>Can resize without loss of image quality</li>
                                <li>Written using SVG markup. Can be easily modified by web designers</li>
                            </ul>
                        <hr>

                        <h3>What is an API</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>API - Application Programing Interfaces</li>
                                <li>Written to provide a set of instructions and standards for using a specific service</li>
                                <li>Usually written to allow developers an easier time to make an application or use services</li>
                                <li>Allows websites to have functionality far beyond what they normally could do</li>
                                <li>Each API is slightly different</li>
                                <li>APIs limit the type of data they expose</li>
                                <li>APIs can be unreliable depending on who hosts it</li>
                                <li>Creating API connected apps can be time consuming if the API changes while it is still being written.</li>
                                <li>HTML5 introduced APIs such as geolocation, and drag & drop</li>
                            </ul>
                        <hr>

                        <h3>HTML5 APIs</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>HTML5 was designed to allow integration of many capabilities that web apps needed.</li>
                                <li>Media API allows controlling loading and playback of media</li>
                                <li>Text Track API controls subtitles/captions</li>
                                <li>Drag & drop API allows elements to be draggable within the browser.</li>
                                <li>App Cache API lets persistent web apps to keep working even if they are disconnected</li>
                                <li>Geolocation access location of users</li>
                                <li>Canvas API allows you to draw on the browser.</li>
                                <li>By having a standardized set of APIs, designers can build complex interfaces that function more like an application than a simple website</li>
                            </ul>
                        <hr>

                        <h3>Web Fonts</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Previously needed to display fonts that were installed on the client's machine</li>
                                <li>Web-fonts automatically download and temporarily install fonts on the client</li>
                                <li>@font-face technique</li>
                                <li>Requests a font from the web server which is downloaded and temp installed on the browser</li>
                                <li>Had legal issues and concerns with end users</li>
                                <li>Led to development of new font formats such as EOT or WOFF</li>
                                <li>These two compress fonts and optimize for screen usage</li>
                                <li>Can use Typekit to avoid problems with browser implementations or legality</li>
                                <li>Front-end designers can now decide what type of typefaces they want to use, allowing for creation of visually sophisticated web</li>
                            </ul>

                        <h3>Server-Side Scripting</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Any scripting or programming that runs on a web server is referred to as server-side scripting</li>
                                <li>Examples: processing form, registering new user, booking a hotel room</li>
                                <li>CGI scripts were used in the earlier days</li>
                                <li>CGI - Common Gateway Interface, created to run scripts from languages such as C+ or Perl</li>
                                <li>Web page first processes the script before page is rendered</li>
                                <li>Scripts are hidden from the user, creating a layer of security between data and source code.</li>
                                <li>Web server most host the application. This can lead to issues when the server is hit by lots of requests, such as slowdown.</li>
                                <li>Client side scripting has become more popular due to the issues that Server side scripting presents</li>
                            </ul>
                        <hr>

                        <h3>The important of PHP</h3>

                                <li>PHP code embedded within a pages HTML</li>
                                <li>Any HTML that ends with .php/.asp/.aspx/.cfm requires it to be processed first</li>
                                <li>Has identifier to distinguish between processing code and HTML code</li>
                                <li>Echo function just displays whatever the result was on the actual page</li>

                        <h3>Dealing with Data</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Typically, data can be stored on the client as txt files</li>
                                <li>Browsers are limited to using cookies, small text files. </li>
                                <li>This is due to security concerns</li>
                                <li>Web storage API, introduced by HTML5</li>
                                <li>Websites store key value pairs within the browser.</li>

                                <li>Both implement use of JavaScript to store/retrieve data</li>
                                <li>Best way to store data is by using databases</li>
                                <li>Databases contain lots of different tables, which can relate to each other. </li>
                                <li>This allows you to create complex interactions between data</li>
                                <li>Databases aren’t just limited to text either.</li>
