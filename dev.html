<h1>A short description about myself</h1>
<p>Currently attending Fresno City College as a full time student. I am currently studying in Computer Science with the hopes of learning as many coding languages as possible some day. Even though I'm majoring in Comp Sci, I enjoy math and physical science and am interested in learning as much as possible in those two subjects. I love animals, dogs in particular, and have about 10 pets in total. During my free time I enjoy walking my dog(s) and doing programming assignments for fun. When I'm really stressed out, I settle down playing video games to get my mind off things for a bit.</p>
